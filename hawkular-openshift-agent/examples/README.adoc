# Examples

This directory contains example applications using the Hawkular OpenShift Agent.

## Jolokia Wildfly Example

This example installs the Jolokia JVM agent into a Wildfly 10 instance and is configured to expose the Heap Memory Used metric.

Since a Jolokia endpoint exposes a full JMX endpoint, it is essential to make sure that this endpoint is secured under https and also requires authentication to access it.

### Deploying
The link:jolokia-wildfly-example/jolokia-wildfly.yaml[jolokia-wildfly] template can be used to deploy this example:
```
$ oc process -f jolokia-wildfly-example/jolokia-wildfly.yaml | oc create -f -
```

## Prometheus Python Example

This example will start up a simple python application which will expose an unsecured Prometheus endpoint. As an unsecured endpoint, any application can access it without having to be authenticated.

### Deploying
The link:prometheus-python-example/prometheus-python.yaml[prometheus-python] template can be used to deploy this example:
```
$ oc process -f prometheus-python-example/prometheus-python.yaml | oc create -f -
```

# Deploying the Examples

If you only want to deploy pre-built example images that are published on Docker Hub, you just need to get the https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-openshift-agent/blob/master/examples/deploy-example.sh[deploy-example.sh] script and run it. It takes a command line argument whose name is one of the examples (e.g. jolokia-wildfly-example).

To easily deploy an example, you can run this one line command (this example deploys the `jolokia-wildfly-example` but you can pass in the name of any example you want; e.g. `multiple-endpoints-example`):

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hawkular/hawkular-openshift-agent/master/examples/deploy-example.sh && sh ./deploy-example.sh jolokia-wildfly-example
```

# Building the Examples

Each of the example directories contains a `Makefile` which can be used to build the examples.

## Building the Docker Image

```
$ make
```

Once built, you can deploy and undeploy the examples via the Makefile:

Deploy:

```
$ make openshift-deploy
```

Undeploy:

```
$ make openshift-undeploy
```
