# deploy-example.sh
#
# Run this script to deploy example pods into your OpenShift node that can
# then be monitored by the Hawkular OpenShift Agent.
#
# The purpose of this script to enable someone to deploy the examples if
# all they have is this script. There is no need to git clone the
# source repository and no need to build anything. OpenShift will download
# the example docker images from docker hub.
#
# If the user has not yet logged into OpenShift via "oc login" then this
# script will log in for you (you will have to enter your credentials
# at the prompts). By default, the example will be deployed in the
# OpenShift user's current project. You can change the project that the
# example is deployed to via the "oc project" command or by setting
# the EXAMPLE_NAMESPACE environment variable when running this script.
#
# To customize this script, these environment variables are used:
#
#   DOCKER_VERSION:
#      The version of the example to deploy.
#      If not specified, the default value is "latest".
#
#   EXAMPLE_NAMESPACE:
#      The namespace (aka OpenShift project) where the example
#      is to be deployed.
#      If not specified, the default is the OpenShift user default.
#
# Examples:
#
# 1. To deploy the latest version of the jolokia-wildfly-example:
#
#   deploy-example.sh jolokia-wildfly-example
#
# 2. To deploy version "1.4.0.Final" of the multiple-endpoints-example
#    into the myproject project:
#
#   DOCKER_VERSION=1.4.0.Final EXAMPLE_NAMESPACE=myproject deploy-example.sh multiple-endpoints-example
